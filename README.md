Welcome to my very very first Python Project!

This project is part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

It's taken a lot of experimentation, trial, and at times, mostly error.  

You can check it out on Heroku [here](https://battleshipsjk2.herokuapp.com/)


## Project Description

This project was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage python code. 

Current game set to 8*8 board, 1 cell ship size and 10 turns.

To play, try to guess the rows & colums (grid reference) that contain enemy ships.

Entering a row and column will fire a missile at the grid reference.

You have 10 missiles / tries to win.

Good luck !!!
